# A SIMPLE BOOK DIARY WEBAPP

As part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, I created a simple book diary/library webapp using JS objects and arrays.

I was able to successfully implement an object constructor that handles user input and creates a 'Book' object which is then passed to an array - this array is then looped over to create the book library.

As the library buuldings in my hometown are often in a 1960s Brutalist architecture style, I decided to try my hand at styling this webapp as a "Brutalist Website", taking inspiration from [here](https://brutalistwebsites.com/).
